# Vision

Our application aims to assist students in finding compatible roommates by leveraging a concept similar to popular dating apps like Tinder. During the onboarding process, users complete a detailed questionnaire to specify their preferences and personal traits. This helps ensure better compatibility between potential roommates. The questionnaire includes aspects such as:

- Sleep schedule
- Hobbies and interests
- Smoking habits
- Drinking habits
- personality type (introverted/extraverted)
- Year of study
- Faculty or department
- Relationship status

The user interface is designed to resemble that of dating apps, providing a familiar and intuitive experience. Users are presented with profiles that include key information and a compatibility score, prioritizing the best matches first. 

The interaction is simple:
- Swipe right if the profile seems like a good match.
- Swipe left to skip the profile.

When two users mutually express interest, their contact information is shared, enabling them to connect and discuss further. Additionally, users have the flexibility to remove themselves from the system if they are no longer interested in finding a roommate.
